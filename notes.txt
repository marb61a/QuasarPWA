Quasar Framework
    - https://quasar.dev/
    - VueJS based
    - A single codebase can be deployed to multiple platforms

Running the project
    - cd into the project folder
    - To run the project
        - At the cli enter -- quasar dev
        - By default this is ran in SPA mode
    - To run the project in PWA mode
        - quasar dev -m pwa
        - This mode will interfere with Hot Relaoding and other items
            - This is down to doing stuff like caching
        - It may be better to develop in standard SPA mode until adding PWA items

Folder Structure
    - src folder will be the main folder that concerns
    - The index.template.html file is the main html file
    - The q-app div will be where the main Vue component will be loaded
